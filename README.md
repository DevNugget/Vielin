# Vielin Programming Language
A passion project, to try and make a set of syntax fun to use.  
**[WARNING] This language is still under development, and may not be suitable for serious work.**
Vielin translates to Nim and then compiled.

# Requirements
- A C compiler (gcc or clang)
- Nim
- Python3 (only for Windows systems)

# Running code
Linux operating systems:  
```
./main {filename} {name-of-compiled-file: output is recommended} {compile-mode: com to compile normally and comr to compile and run}
```

Windows operating systems:  
```
python main.py {filename} {name-of-compiled-file: output is recommended} {compile-mode: com to compile normally and comr to compile and run}
```

# How do I use Vielin?
I tried to specify as much as I could in the **examples folder**, will write a documentation soon!
