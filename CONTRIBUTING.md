## General rules and regulations
**Please do not over-complicate how the translator (main.py) works.**
- The reason why the translator is written in the way it is right now is due to my small brain, and I wanted to make this project personally enjoyable to work on. So please keep the logic behind the translator the same.
- Obviously use common sense and don't mess anything up.

## What would be appreciated
- Writing the translator in some other language (because python is slow).
- Help adding to the examples folder.
- Adding new features to the language itself.
